# F3 "I want each path linked to its metadata"

## Value

Paths change over time as files are reorganized. By keeping a reference from every location to the same metadata, Home Index lets you move files freely without losing track of their history or searchability.

## Specification

### Vocabulary

| Kind       | Syntax on the trace | Payload / meaning |
| ---------- | ------------------- | ----------------- |
| **input**  | `LINK(p, id)`       | register path `p` for file ID `id` |
| **input**  | `QUERY(p)`          | request metadata for path `p` |
| **output** | `PATH_LINKED(p)`    | symlink `metadata/by-path/{p}` → `../by-id/{id}` |
| **output** | `RESULT(m)`         | metadata `m` returned to caller |

| **P₁ mapping**   | `G( LINK(p, id) → F PATH_LINKED(p) )` | *Every link eventually creates a path record.* |
| **P₂ lookup**    | `G( QUERY(p) → F RESULT(m) )`        | *Every query eventually produces metadata.* |
