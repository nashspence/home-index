# F3. "I want metadata for files on offline media"

## Value

Keeping metadata for removable drives lets you search their contents even when the drive is unplugged. When you reattach the drive the files resume syncing normally.

---

## Usage

Archive drives or other removable media should be mounted under the path defined by the `ARCHIVE_DIRECTORY` environment variable. It defaults to `"/files/archive"` relative to `INDEX_DIRECTORY`.
When a drive is not mounted, the sync process leaves any existing documents and symlinks intact so searches still return results. If a file is deleted while the drive is online the next sync removes its document and symlink.

Metadata migrations from Feature F2 still run on these stored documents so the schema stays current. Feature F4 modules only process a file when at least one of its paths is available.

On every sync Home Index updates two flags for each document:
`has_archive_paths` signals that at least one path lives under `ARCHIVE_DIRECTORY` and `offline` becomes `true` when **all** those archive paths are currently unavailable. Both fields persist alongside the rest of the metadata and are exposed in Meilisearch so the search index always reflects the current archive state.

---

## Minimal `docker-compose.yml`

```yaml
services:
  home-index:
    image: ghcr.io/nashspence/home-index:latest
    environment:
      - METADATA_DIRECTORY=/home-index/metadata
    volumes:
      - ./input:/files:ro
      - ./output:/home-index
    depends_on:
      - meilisearch
  meilisearch:
    image: getmeili/meilisearch:latest
    environment:
      - MEILI_NO_ANALYTICS=true
    volumes:
      - ./output/meili:/meili_data
```

Place your archive mount at `./input/archive`. When the drive is unplugged the folder may be empty but the container retains the previous metadata so you can still search the files.

---

## User Testing

```bash
mkdir -p input/archive/drive1 output
echo archived > input/archive/drive1/foo.txt
IMAGE=ghcr.io/nashspence/home-index:latest docker compose up -d

# drive unplugged
rm -r input/archive/drive1
docker compose up -d

# drive reattached without the file
mkdir -p input/archive/drive1
docker compose up -d
```

The first run indexes the file. When the drive is absent the second run leaves the metadata intact. The final run deletes the document and symlink for `foo.txt` because the file no longer exists on the connected drive.

---

## Input â†” Output

| **Your single action** | **What you will literally see** |
| --- | --- |
| Run `docker compose up -d` without the archive drive mounted | The stored document and symlink for `archive/drive1/foo.txt` remain under `./output/metadata/`. |
| Run `docker compose up -d` after reconnecting the drive without `foo.txt` | Both the document and symlink for `archive/drive1/foo.txt` vanish from `./output/metadata/`. |

---

## Acceptance

1. Metadata for paths inside `ARCHIVE_DIRECTORY` is retained when the files are absent.
2. When an archived file is removed and sync runs again, its document and symlink are deleted.
3. Each document stores `has_archive_paths` and `offline` fields that update to reflect the current state every time sync runs.
