# F2 "I want metadata stored by file ID"

## Value

Storing metadata under a stable identifier ensures your catalog remains intact even when files move or get renamed. By detaching data from paths, the system prevents duplication and makes metadata retrieval straightforward, so you always find accurate details about your files.

## Specification

### Vocabulary

| Kind       | Syntax on the trace | Payload / meaning |
| ---------- | ------------------- | ----------------- |
| **input**  | `WRITE(id, m)`      | save metadata `m` for file ID `id` |
| **input**  | `READ(id)`          | request metadata for `id` |
| **output** | `META_WRITTEN(id)`  | file `metadata/by-id/{id}/document.json` exists |
| **output** | `META_RETURNED(m)`  | JSON `m` read back from that path |

### Contract = P₁ ∧ P₂

| Label | MTL formula | Natural-language reading |
| ----- | ----------- | ----------------------- |
| **P₁ persistence** | `G( WRITE(id, m) → F META_WRITTEN(id) )` | *Every write eventually results in a stored file.* |
| **P₂ retrieval**   | `G( READ(id) → F META_RETURNED(m) )`    | *Every read eventually yields the metadata.* |
