Machine learning is the study of computer algorithms that improve automatically through experience. It is seen as a part of artificial intelligence. Machine learning algorithms build a model based on sample data, known as training data, to make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed to do so. These algorithms are employed in a wide range of applications, such as in medicine, email filtering, and computer vision, where designing conventional algorithms to perform the needed tasks would be difficult or infeasible. The ability to learn from data and adapt over time makes machine learning useful for tasks that involve recognizing patterns in large datasets. This test ensures concept search can retrieve this text when queries mention algorithms learning from data.
